    1. We think this strategy of creating and delivering textbooks as services can help build an incredible business. The publishing market is valued at Â£20bn and our software is able to reverse the trend of textbooks losing their relevance. Because remember: for the first time in history, only 10% of teachers use textbooks!
    2. We are not going to stop there. The next step for us is to bring together all the content which teachers (61m worldwide) co-create using our platform and open it up to the marketplace in the years to come. We think this is an even bigger growth opportunity.
